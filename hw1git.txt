Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I have chosen the data science track for my computer science major. Seeing as how this is a Intro to Data Science class it just made sense for me to take it so that I may have a better understanding of the career that I have chose and get some experience in it as well. Additionally, this is a required class that I have to take as a computer science major.
